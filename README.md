# simon_game
Simon was originally an electronic game in which the device had 4 colored buttons, each producing a particular sound when pressed. In each round the device lights up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. 

In my Simon game web app at each level a new color is shown and the player must click all the buttons including the new one in the same order.
