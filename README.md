# simon_game
Simon is originally an electronic game in which the device has 4 colored buttons, each producing a particular sound when pressed. In each round the device lights up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. 

In the Simon game website at each level a new color is shown and the player must click all the buttons including the new one in the same order .
